## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have a compatible Linux distribution (either RedHat-based or Debian-based).

### Step 1: Install Ansible

To install Ansible, you can use the provided `ansible_install.sh` script, which will automatically detect your OS and install Ansible.

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/[your-github-username]/[your-repository-name].git
    cd [your-repository-name]
    ```

2. Make the script executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x ansible_install.sh
    ```

3. Run the script to install Ansible:
    ```bash
    ./ansible_install.sh
    ```

The script will automatically detect your OS (RedHat-based or Debian-based) and install Ansible using the appropriate package manager.
